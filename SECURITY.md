# Security

Orbital Engagement Lab is research and prototyping software. It is not
flight-qualified software and should not be used as an operational decision
system without independent mission-specific validation.

## Reporting A Vulnerability

Please report suspected security issues privately through GitHub Security
Advisories when available, or to the repository maintainers through a private
channel. Do not open a public issue for vulnerabilities, leaked secrets,
customer data, CUI, export-controlled data, or classified information.

Include:

- a short description of the issue
- steps to reproduce
- affected versions or commits, if known
- any relevant logs or proof-of-concept details

Best-effort response targets for the public project:

- acknowledge receipt within 3 business days,
- provide initial triage within 10 business days,
- provide a remediation plan for critical/high findings within 30 calendar
  days,
- publish or privately deliver a fix as soon as practical after validation.

Customer or pilot agreements may define stricter response targets.

## Supported Versions

Security fixes target the current public release line, currently `v0.27.3`, and
active private/Pro customer-supported release lines. The project targets Python
3.10 through 3.14. The authoritative local release gate exercises the blocking
Python 3.11 lane and retains evidence for the wider compatibility matrix
described in [`docs/compatibility.md`](docs/compatibility.md). Hosted Windows
and native-Linux cFS workflows are manual advisory diagnostics only: they have
no pull-request or scheduled trigger and are not release authority. Evaluators should run
acceptance on their exact target interpreter and operating system.
Python 3.9 is no longer a supported procurement baseline because several
vulnerability fixes in the Python packaging and ML/plotting ecosystem require
Python 3.10 or newer.

Commands below use `python` after activating the environment. See
[`docs/installation.md`](docs/installation.md) for explicit Windows PowerShell
and macOS/Linux interpreter paths; activation is optional when using those
paths directly.

## Supported Scope

Security reports are most useful when they affect:

- arbitrary code execution through scenario loading or plugin pointers
- unsafe handling of local files or paths
- dependency or packaging risks
- external integration or adapter surfaces

Simulation-model correctness issues are also welcome, but they may be handled as
engineering bugs rather than security vulnerabilities unless they create a clear
security impact.

For non-security bugs, use the public repository's GitHub Issues and the Bug
Report template. Do not include sensitive data in public issues.

## Running Untrusted Scenarios

Treat scenario YAML as trusted input. Normal validation imports configured
Python plugin modules so it can check controller, guidance, bridge, and mission
contracts. For a first pass over a scenario from an untrusted source, use:

```bash
python run_simulation.py --config <path> --safe-validate
```

Safe validation checks YAML structure, path policy, and plugin pointer shape
without importing configured plugin modules. It does not make the scenario safe
to execute.

For shared, classroom, government, or other restricted environments, use sealed
mode for validation and execution:

```bash
python run_simulation.py --config <path> --sealed-mode --validate-only
python run_simulation.py --config <path> --sealed-mode
```

Sealed mode allows built-in OEL plugin modules, but blocks arbitrary plugin
module imports, hosted AI providers, custom AI endpoints, full run logs, full review stores, raw Monte Carlo payloads,
and non-summary AI report packets by default. Each exception requires an
explicit CLI opt-in such as `--allow-untrusted-plugin-imports`,
`--allow-hosted-ai`, `--allow-custom-ai-endpoints`, or
`--allow-high-detail-outputs`. Sealed mode blocks **all** cFS/SIL socket
networking, including loopback UDP, unless the separately documented isolated
test policy opt-in is active; ordinary adapter/network scope controls are not
sealed-mode bypasses by themselves.

External paths, external AI prompt files, custom AI endpoints, forwarding hosted
provider API keys to custom endpoints, and insecure custom AI endpoints all require explicit opt-in flags or environment
variables. Use those only for trusted local or isolated-network workflows.

## Dependency Audit

The authoritative local release gate runs a Python dependency audit with
`pip-audit`. Hosted diagnostics do not repeat that audit. Run the same local
check directly with:

```bash
python -m pip install -U pip-audit
python -m pip_audit
```

Generate supply-chain evidence for procurement review with:

```bash
python -m pip install -c constraints/py311.txt ".[cross-platform]" --report outputs/supply_chain/pip-install-report.json
python -m pip check > outputs/supply_chain/pip-check.txt
python tools/generate_dependency_evidence.py --install-report outputs/supply_chain/pip-install-report.json --constraints constraints/py311.txt --output outputs/supply_chain/wheel-inventory.json
python tools/generate_python_sbom.py --output outputs/supply_chain/sbom.cdx.json
python -m pip freeze --all > outputs/supply_chain/python-freeze.txt
python -m pip_audit --format json --output outputs/supply_chain/pip-audit.json
```
