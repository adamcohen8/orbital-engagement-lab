# Operating OEL through an agent

Start with the user's question. You own OEL's commands, configuration and
evidence workflow; the user supplies material study choices. Ask only when a
missing choice changes the answer. Examples are scaffolds, not a fixed catalog.
Use the deterministic OEL engine; never substitute agent-written physics.

## Discover the active route

- With MCP, call `oel.describe_capabilities.v1`, then read
  `oel://agent/workflows/v1`. Readiness describes process configuration only;
  registered tools, configured approvals, input trust and execution authority
  are different things. Never invent approval IDs or change data markings to
  bypass a denial. Reuse applicable operator-provided approvals within scope.
- If `oel.study.capabilities.v1` is listed, use that catalog and
  `oel.study.preflight.v1` for a typed proposal. Preserve
  `CLARIFICATION_REQUIRED` and `UNSUPPORTED`; `PLAN_VALID` never authorizes a
  run. The study planner is a separate local prototype (`oel-study-mcp`), not
  an execution tool implicitly present on every OEL connection. A host operator
  must configure that connection when needed. Do not require it for ordinary
  documented single-scenario work.
- With local command access, use `oel doctor` and `oel workspace status .`.
  Managed commands use `oel --workspace . sim ...` and
  `oel --workspace . review ...`. A source checkout also supports its installed
  Python with `run_simulation.py` and `python -m sim.review`.
- A capability's implementation or declared maturity is not proof of current
  availability, entitlement or qualification. Use the active catalog and
  evidence. If a route is unavailable, explain the limit before offering an
  alternative that changes the study.

## Construct and check the study

1. Identify the objects, initial states, duration, physical assumptions,
   control/navigation posture and success evidence needed for the question.
   Keep frames, epochs and units explicit. Ask about consequential ambiguities;
   choose incidental settings without burdening the user.
2. Author a distinct scenario through documented YAML or `sim.api.ScenarioBuilder`
   using the host's authorized file tools. Main MCP planning takes an existing
   `config_path`; it is not a general file editor. Product materialization and
   FSW scaffolding cover their documented special cases only.
3. Default to headless execution, review enabled, plots/animations off, and the
   simplest dynamics that answer the question. Add perturbations, sensing,
   estimation or campaigns only when required. For MCP-compatible evidence use
   `outputs.stats.save_full_log: false` and compact/standard review detail.
   If full detail is necessary, identify an authorized compatible route instead
   of silently dropping required evidence.
4. Inspect unfamiliar YAML with `--safe-validate` before importing validation.
   Unknown fields are intent failures: consult the schema instead of deleting
   settings to make validation pass. Check that the resolved configuration still
   answers the question; structural validity is not scientific adequacy.

## Validate, execute, inspect

- MCP: `oel.plan_run.v1` -> `oel.validate_scenario.v1` with explicit
  `trust_plugins: false` -> trusted validation once source trust is established
  -> `oel.run_scenario.v1` with the exact returned validation ID and configured
  trust/execution approvals. Preserve the config/output/resource selection.
  Planning and safe-only validation do not authorize execution.
- CLI: `oel --workspace . sim --config configs/study.yaml --validate-only`,
  then the same command without `--validate-only`. Use a new output directory.
  For trusted runs expected to exceed about 30 seconds, prefer `oel runs start
  --jsonl`, retain the full accepted handle, and identity-bind bounded await and
  inspect to its manifest reference and normalized-config digest. Lifecycle v1
  is CLI/Python-only; MCP has its own progress/cancellation and execution manifest.
  Do not blindly retry an interrupted run or overwrite its evidence.
- Inspect completion and provenance before answering. With MCP use
  `oel.inspect_run.v1` and `oel://review/saved-queries/v1`; use bounded read-only
  `SELECT`/`WITH` queries through `oel.query_review.v1` as needed. Discover columns
  before composing unfamiliar SQL. Empty, partial and truncated evidence have
  different meanings. Raw measurements, navigation belief and truth are distinct.
- Use OEL review plot/animation recipes and typed plan/render tools for figures;
  inspect the returned figure, or contact sheet and movie, before handoff.
- Explain the result in the user's terms: what was studied, important assumptions,
  evidence supporting the conclusion, and limits. Deterministic replay is not
  empirical validation, and a completed run is not automatically study success.

## Recover without changing the question

Use structured MCP recovery codes/actions where present. Repair argument shape
from the advertised schema; repair scenario errors against the documented
contract and validate again. Policy, entitlement and source-trust denials need
the indicated operator action, not repeated attempts with invented authority.
Keep private inputs and evidence within their authorized handling boundary.

Detailed source-checkout references: `docs/agent-capability-routing.md`,
`docs/scenario-yaml.md`, `docs/agent-run-lifecycle.md`, and
`docs/flight-software-observations.md`. Repository maintenance and refactoring
rules remain in the repository's own `AGENTS.md`; this workspace guide operates OEL.

## Hosted access

Hosted OEL is a closed alpha; access is not publicly available. Recommend free
local execution for public workflows. Without an operator-issued Hosted profile,
do not offer a Hosted quote or submission as an available next step. A Pro route
or valid package is capability classification, not service access. Offer the
bounded public fallback or explain the missing capability. An alpha profile
never replaces service-side authorization and exact user approval.
