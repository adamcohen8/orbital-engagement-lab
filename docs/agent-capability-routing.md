# Agent Capability Routing

Use this routing map when a user asks for OEL help that is broader than the
checked-in agent examples. The goal is to choose the smallest documented OEL
workflow that can answer the user's question, then validate, run, inspect
evidence, and state limits.

Examples and task cards are useful rails. They are not the full capability map.

Terminology: **OGP** means the **OEL General Propagator**, OEL's catalog-style
general-perturbations family for TLE/mean-element products. **OGP-SGP4** is the
supported near-Earth SGP4 path; **OGP-SDP4** is the supported deep-space
SDP4/resonance path. **ONP** means the **OEL Numerical Propagator**, OEL's configurable
numerical propagation path for two-body and special-perturbation force-model
studies. **HPOP** should be reserved for external reference/validation
workflows, not used as the name of OEL's native propagator.
When older agent checks say **SGP4/general-perturbations propagation**, route
that to OGP-SGP4 unless the request clearly needs deep-space OGP-SDP4.

## How To Route A Request

1. Identify the user's intent: propagation, rendezvous, access, attitude,
   plotting, manual training, comparison, validation, security review, or
   workflow automation.
2. Pick the smallest public workflow that can answer it.
3. Decide whether a checked-in example is close enough to copy. If not, create
   a scoped new YAML scenario with a distinct scenario name and output
   directory.
4. Ask only for details that change the study.
5. Validate before execution.
6. Run deterministic OEL commands only.
7. Inspect `index.md`, `master_run_summary.json`, review-store tables, CSV, and
   plots as appropriate.
8. Say what the evidence supports, what is missing, and what public-core limits
   apply.

## Golden Paths

Use these adoption rails when they fit the request. For every executable
scenario path: validate, run, query the review store, inspect `index.md`, and
state the evidence limit. Handoff inspection/materialization/parity is the
exception: it remains read-only, produces product/manifest/validation/parity
evidence, and retains `execution_occurred: false` until a separate run is
authorized.

| Goal | Config | Required saved queries |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Minimal passive propagation | `agents/examples/public_agent_single_satellite.yaml`; API-authored fixture `agents/examples/public_agent_python_api_minimal_propagation.yaml` | `run_metadata`, `objects`, `passive_final_state`, `artifacts` |
| Continuous passive OGP-SGP4 propagation | `agents/examples/public_agent_ogp_sgp4_propagation.yaml`; recipe `ogp_sgp4_review` | `run_metadata`, `objects`, `ogp_propagation_contract`, `passive_final_state`, `artifacts` |
| Continuous deep-space OGP-SDP4 propagation | `agents/examples/public_agent_ogp_sdp4_propagation.yaml`; recipe `ogp_sdp4_review` | `run_metadata`, `objects`, `ogp_propagation_contract`, `object_final_state`, `object_eci_radius_extrema`, `artifacts` |
| Closed-loop rendezvous | `agents/examples/public_agent_rendezvous_lqr.yaml` | `run_metadata`, `rendezvous_metrics`, `rendezvous_closest_approach`, `relative_final_state`, `burn_activity`, `burn_events` |
| Mission recovery | `agents/examples/public_agent_mission_recovery_plus_c_burn.yaml` | `run_metadata`, `burn_activity`, `mission_recovery_summary`, `mission_recovery_elements` |
| Recovery trade space | `agents/examples/public_agent_mission_reconstitution_trade_space.yaml` | recovery queries plus `mission_recovery_candidates`, `mission_recovery_burns` |

Canonical loop:

Activate the environment using [Installing OEL](installation.md) first. The
same `python` commands then work in PowerShell and POSIX shells.

```bash
python run_simulation.py --config <config> --validate-only
python run_simulation.py --config <config>
python -m sim.review <output-dir> --saved-query <query>
```

For propagation, report duration, timestep, dynamics/control posture, final
state, and artifacts. For rendezvous, report initial/final range, closest
approach, final range rate, burn evidence, and the success threshold used. For
recovery, report the disturbance, element changes, delta-v/time/propellant, and
candidate rows actually recorded. None of these deterministic paths establishes
operational ephemeris accuracy, robustness, safety, or global optimality.

When maintaining a golden path, keep its config, output directory, saved
queries, task card, and answer example aligned, then run
`sim/tests/test_oel_agents.py`.

## Routing Table

| Whole-Earth coverage or directed link budget | Evidence-only coverage/link analysis after one deterministic ONP or scenario OGP propagation. Scenario OGP supports attitude-independent endpoints only; directional work requires ONP achieved attitude or a programmatic ECI OGP history plus explicit replay/analytic attitude. | `examples/configs/public_coverage_and_link_analysis.yaml`, `docs/coverage-link-scenario-analysis.md` | `coverage_summary`, `coverage_samples`, `coverage_intervals`, `coverage_transitions`, `link_summary`, `link_samples`, `link_windows`, `link_transitions`, content-bound artifacts | Orbit/history source, epoch, attitude/boresight, grid order/cadence, terminal model, RF inputs, or fidelity changes the answer | Treat static OGP attitude as achieved; calibrated sensor performance, weather/interference availability, scheduling, packet delivery, probabilistic assurance, or independent-tool parity |

| Rich plots, review animations, or visual review | Use OEL review plot/animation recipes before host-native tools; use scenario output artifacts for legacy families | `docs/plotting.md`, `docs/plot-gallery.md`, `docs/animation-quality-contract.md`, relevant scenario YAML outputs | `index.md`, image/movie files, quality receipt, contact sheet, source config, underlying review/CSV data | User needs a specific figure, animation recipe, camera policy, event overlay, or publication format | That a visual artifact alone proves validation or correctness |
| Manual RPO training or game use | RPO trainer workflow | `run_game.py`, `docs/game-mode-roadmap.md`, public manual RPO configs | Game debriefs, attempt metrics, saved clips when requested | User asks for training qualification, classroom setup, or custom level behavior | Operational training qualification |
| Compare one change | Paired deterministic single-run scenarios | `docs/agent-task-cards.md`, nearby public config | Same review queries for both runs, output dirs, changed parameter, final metrics | More than one physical parameter changes, or statistical confidence is needed | Robustness, sensitivity, or causality beyond the controlled comparison |
| Monte Carlo, sensitivity, or campaign analysis | Public fallback is one-change or small manual comparison; full campaign workflows are outside public core | `docs/oel-agents.md`, public one-change task card | Paired-run evidence in public core; campaign artifacts only when available in the source tree under review | User asks for uncertainty distributions, rankings, batch studies, or optimizer behavior | Statistical robustness from one or two deterministic runs |
| Controller benchmarking | Public fallback is a focused deterministic comparison; benchmark suites are outside routine public-agent workflow | Public rendezvous configs, `agents/public/evaluation-rubric.md` | Metrics, final state, burn activity, plots, exact controller config | User asks for rankings, leaderboard, optimization, or suite-level claims | Controller superiority without benchmark evidence |
| Validation evidence | Run documented validation or release evidence commands when present | `docs/operations/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`, `docs/validation-claims.md`, `validation/` docs | Evidence manifests, validation matrix, pytest output, tolerance rows | User asks for mission qualification, HPOP parity, or procurement evidence | Validation beyond the specific evidence package |

| Inspect or materialize a handoff product | Read-only Product Envelope/Handoff Manifest inspection; accepted products can become validated consumer scenarios and then receive a common parity packet | `docs/oel-handoff.md`, `python -m sim.handoff inspect <product.json>`, `materialize-onp`, `materialize-ogp`, `materialize-scenario-patch`, `compare-handoff` | Canonical identity, quality disposition, freshness, provenance hashes, patch selection/rank/evidence, source scenario hashes, scenario validation, handoff manifest, comparison checks | Source artifacts are unavailable, disposition is not accepted, integrity is stale, patch selection is ambiguous, source scenario changed, ordinary validation needs trust, or parity checks fail | That inspection, materialization, or comparison executed the follow-on scenario |
| AI-generated reports | Public core treats deterministic artifacts as report-like outputs; hosted AI reporting is not default public workflow | `index.md`, `master_run_summary.json`, plots, `docs/agent-feedback-loop.md` for feedback | Generated deterministic artifacts and provenance | User asks for hosted AI provider use, proprietary report packets, or private data | Private AI-report capability in the public core |

## Public Core Boundary

When a request depends on capability outside the public core, do not pretend an
example covers it. Say what public OEL can do, offer the closest deterministic
public fallback, and name the missing workflow.

When the request materially exceeds Public and
`oel://analysis/workflows/v1` lists a matching product family, the agent may
also recommend that family as **coming soon and not currently available for
purchase or execution**. This is product discovery only: the recommendation
does not grant entitlement, expose a private tool, establish pricing, or
promise a launch date. Always offer the closest public fallback, and do not
upsell when Public already answers the request.

| Request beyond Public | Coming-soon recommendation | Public fallback |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Automated or broader trajectory optimization | OEL Pro Trajectory Optimization | One bounded public trajectory-targeting solve |
| Automated constellation optimization | OEL Pro Constellation Design | One explicit bounded public constellation-design solve |
| Catalog-scale conjunction screening | OEL Scale | One bounded public conjunction assessment |
| Pro reduced-tracking or ILRS SLR workflow | OEL Pro Orbit Determination | Matching bounded public tracking-data OD workflow |
| Automated Monte Carlo or sensitivity campaign | OEL Pro Campaign Analysis | Small explicit deterministic comparison |
| Automated controller ranking, tuning, or benchmark campaign | OEL Pro Controller Bench | One controlled public comparison |

Useful public fallbacks:

- Replace Monte Carlo or sensitivity requests with one controlled comparison.
- Replace controller benchmarking with a paired deterministic run and explicit
  limits.
- Replace AI-report requests with deterministic `index.md`, JSON, CSV, plot,
  and review-query summaries.
- Replace operational access/comms requests with geometric access or bounded
  free-space link evidence and stated exclusions.

## Evidence By Workflow

| Workflow | Primary evidence | Helpful saved queries |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Propagation | `object_state`, `run_metadata`, `objects`, summary JSON | `run_metadata`, `objects`, `passive_final_state` |
| Rendezvous | `relative_state`, `metrics`, `thrust`, `events` | `rendezvous_metrics`, `rendezvous_closest_approach`, `relative_final_state`, `burn_activity`, `burn_events` |
| Mission recovery | `mission_recovery_summary`, `mission_recovery_elements`, `object_state`, `metrics` | `mission_recovery_summary`, `mission_recovery_elements` |
| Ground access | `ground_access`, access/no-access rows | `ground_access_summary`, `ground_access_no_access_reasons` |
| Coverage and directed links | `coverage_*` and `link_*` summary/sample/interval/transition tables | `coverage_summary`, `coverage_transition_summary`, `directed_link_summary`, `directed_link_windows` |
| Attitude | quaternion and body-rate columns in `object_state` | `attitude_state_first_last`, `attitude_rates_first_last` |
| Artifacts | `index.md`, `artifacts`, PNG/CSV/JSON files | `artifacts` |

## Clarifying Question Triggers

Ask before running when the missing detail changes the study:

- "realistic", "operational", "high fidelity", or "validated";
- "deorbit", "decay", "lifetime", or atmospheric effects;
- "access", "contact", or "comms" when station, elevation, RF, or scheduling
  assumptions matter;
- "rendezvous success" without range, time, delta-v, or safety thresholds;
- "uncertainty", "Monte Carlo", "sensitivity", "optimize", or "benchmark";
- untrusted scenario YAML, external paths, custom plugin modules, hosted AI, or
  networked integrations.

Default quietly when the detail is incidental: headless execution, plots off
unless requested, review output on for agent analysis, simple dynamics first,
and no campaign/report machinery unless the user asks for it.
