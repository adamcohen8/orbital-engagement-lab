# Product Inventory

This inventory summarizes the major workflow, controller, and mission surfaces
across the public core and Pro workspace. It answers both "what exists?" and
"what is actually packaged here?" before a user starts reading Python modules
or reverse-engineering scenario YAML.

Use this page with:

- [Scenario YAML](scenario-yaml.md) for pointer syntax.
- the private Controller Bench guide for comparative evaluation workflows;
- [Controller Naming Conventions](project/controller_naming_conventions.md) for
  naming rules when adding or renaming controllers.
- [Reference GNC Library Roadmap](project/reference_gnc_library_roadmap.md) for
  controller and command-module promotion planning.
- [Public Core And Pro Boundary](public-vs-pro.md) for public/pro packaging
  posture.

Inventory labels:

- **Flagship**: curated, product-facing path for demonstrations or evidence.
- **Reference**: supported baseline or reusable building block.
- **Workbench**: useful for engineering studies, tuning, wrapping, or custom
  scenarios.
- **Experimental**: included for exploration; validate before relying on it.
- **Compatibility**: retained for older configs or migration paths.

Packaging and maturity are separate. **Public** means the implementation and
documented workflow ship in the open-core export. **Pro** means the capability
exists in the private product workspace even when a related public primitive is
available.

A working implementation remains **Experimental** until it has a documented
interface, deterministic tests, a maintained workflow, bounded claims, and an
explicit packaging decision.

## Capability Status

| Capability | Packaging | Status | Evidence entry point | Primary limit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scenario YAML, CLI, and Python API | Public | Flagship | [Quickstart](quickstart.md), engine and scenario contracts | Pre-1.0 non-contract fields may still evolve. |
| ONP numerical propagation | Public | Reference | [Physics Model Reference](physics-models.md), public scenarios | Fidelity depends on the configured force models and validation envelope. |
| OGP-SGP4/SDP4 passive propagation | Public | Reference | TLE examples, OGP reference suites, frame provenance | Passive catalog-style propagation; not an operational catalog service. |
| Coverage and directed-link analysis | Public | Experimental | [Scenario workflow](coverage-link-scenario-analysis.md), public example, contracts, and [programmatic acceptance](validation-coverage-link-programmatic.md) | Deterministic sampled engineering analysis; independent external validation, calibrated hardware/environment models, and operational assurance remain outside the claim. |
| Governed communications engineering | Pro | Experimental, unreleased private-worktree surface | Private Pro communications workflow, governed profiles, validation manifest, and content-bound evidence bundle | Enforced by the `pro_communications` feature at direct workflow entry points. Source must be tracked and included in a future Pro package candidate before distribution; included terminals/sites are illustrative, and measured RF, current weather/interference, packet assurance, and operational availability are not claimed. |
| GNC v2 complete-stack runtime and profiles | Public | Mixed | [GNC v2 evidence](gnc-v2-evidence.md), [flight-software profiles](flight-software-profiles.md) | All 18 exact profile versions are Supported only inside their declared simulation qualification envelopes; underlying stacks and arbitrary custom compositions remain Experimental. |
| Public FSW Authoring Kit | Public | Workbench | [Public FSW Authoring](fsw-authoring.md), content-bound validation/test/smoke receipts | ADCS/RPO Python-stack authoring and one deterministic serial smoke only; no comparison, tuning, qualification, external process, or cFS/SIL workflow. |
| Lambert orbit-transfer planning | Public | Workbench | `configs/orbit_transfer_planner_demo.yaml`, review-store candidate tables | Bounded two-body grid search, not operational or globally optimal planning. |

| OGP-SGP4/SDP4 mean-element orbit determination | Pro | Reference | [OD contract](contracts/orbit-determination-contract.md), Phase 6 harness, Scale SGP4 sensor-OD workflow | Regime-bounded same-family L2 OD; B*/epoch gates are case-specific and operational publication remains outside the claim. |
| OGP two-way SLR normal-point orbit determination | Pro | Experimental | [OD contract](contracts/orbit-determination-contract.md), Phase 4 external campaign | L4 measurement-path evidence is limited to one LAGEOS-1 OGP-SDP4 arc with approximate stations and unresolved calibration terms. |
| Initial-orbit and optical angles-only determination | Pro | Experimental | [OD contract](contracts/orbit-determination-contract.md), Phase 5 synthetic campaign | Gibbs/Herrick-Gibbs and ambiguity-aware Gauss/Lambert initialization have bounded L2 synthetic evidence; no operational optical, association, or custody claim. |

| AI-assisted reports and config assistance | Pro | Workbench | Private staged estimate/create workflows | Requires explicit provider, data, cost, and human-review decisions. |
| cFS/SIL common-boundary adapter | Pro/private | Experimental | Private cFS/SIL ICD and byte-level golden vectors | Excluded from the public export; prototype loopback transport and conformance envelope, not flight or real-time qualification. |
| FSW Development and Verification Kit | Pro/private | Workbench | Private FSWDK contract, Controller Bench, qualification, and packaging guides | Strict workflow superset of public authoring; private evidence automation does not turn simulation results into flight qualification. |

## GNC v2 complete stacks

Every satellite using the default `flight_software` runtime profile crosses one
`SatelliteFlightSoftware` boundary. Typed
sensor, command, load, pilot, and telemetry events enter; typed device commands
leave. Navigation, goals, constraint handling, executive logic, guidance,
control, allocation, and stack-owned recovery are internal implementation
details. A propagation-only satellite with no `flight_software` declaration
uses the v2 passive stack. An explicitly declared `runtime_profile:
trajectory_only` bypasses onboard modeling and retains only configured
deterministic dynamics. Any non-empty v1 satellite GNC field is rejected.

| Stack | Hardware currently realized by the reference factory | Included modes | Maturity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `fsw.passive` | Passive | Coast and typed evidence | Experimental |
| `fsw.attitude_reference` | Ideal torque/wrench | Quaternion hold and configured reference pointing | Experimental |
| `fsw.orbit_reference` | Ideal wrench | Stationkeeping and orbital-element feedback | Experimental |
| `fsw.rpo_reference` | Ideal wrench | RIC hold, axis approaches, waypoint, braking, and passive retreat | Experimental |
| `fsw.low_thrust_reference` | Continuous engine with body-frame gimbal commands | Low-thrust phasing | Experimental |
| `fsw.game_pilot_reference` | Ideal wrench or modeled aerodynamic effectors, by declared input profile | Pilot translation, attitude/thrust, operator input, and aerodynamic play | Experimental |

The stack catalog and component catalog are intentionally separate. Public
custom stacks can compose component math without Pro. The Pro Controller Bench
replaces and evaluates complete stack compositions; it is not a second runtime.
See [GNC v2 migration](gnc-v2-migration.md) and
[GNC v2 evidence](gnc-v2-evidence.md).

OEL also ships an initial catalog of 18 versioned
[flight-software use-case profiles](flight-software-profiles.md) across
commissioning/ADCS, absolute-orbit operations, RPO/formation applications, and
low-thrust control. All 18 exact profile versions are Supported inside their
declared simulation qualification envelopes. That maturity does not promote
any underlying stack for arbitrary compositions or parameters outside the
profile envelope.

## Mission And Dynamics Capability Inventory

These surfaces are not all "controllers", but they are user-facing product
capabilities that ship with the simulator and appear in scenario YAML, plots,
payloads, or validation workflows.

| Product surface | Config surface | Status | Primary use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Shared Vehicle Aero Contract | `objects.<id>.specs.aero` | Reference | Canonical vehicle aero properties shared by satellites, re-entry diagnostics, aero-assist studies, and rocket ascent defaults. |
| Orbit Drag Force Model | `simulator.dynamics.orbit.drag` | Reference | Enables atmosphere-relative drag acceleration using configured vehicle area/coefficient and environment density. |
| Atmospheric Lift Force Model | `objects.<id>.specs.aero.cl`, `lift_area_m2`, `lift_axis_body` plus `orbit.drag` | Workbench | First-pass attitude-coupled lift for atmospheric steering and plane-change exploration. |
| Re-entry Diagnostics | `simulator.dynamics.reentry` | Reference | Tracks entry episodes, dynamic pressure, drag g-load, heat rate, heat load, and object-level termination limits. |
| Aero-Assisted Atmospheric Pass | `configs/aero_assisted_plane_change_demo.yaml` | Workbench | Demonstrates a satellite dipping into the atmosphere, using lift-axis steering, then burning to raise altitude. |
| Rocket Ascent Aero | `objects.rocket.specs.aero` plus `simulator.dynamics.rocket.aero` | Workbench | Shared object geometry/defaults with detailed rocket coefficient refinements, max-Q/TVC diagnostics, and insertion studies. |
| Object-Based Aero/Re-entry Termination | `simulator.dynamics.reentry.termination.by_object` and `simulator.termination.by_object` | Reference | Lets rockets, disposed stages, satellites, and atmospheric test articles coexist with different stop conditions. |

Canonical vehicle aero fields live under `objects.<id>.specs.aero`:
`reference_area_m2`, `drag_area_m2`, `lift_area_m2`, `cd`, `cl`,
`nose_radius_m`, `reference_length_m`, `lift_axis_body`/`lift_vector_body`, and
`cp_offset_body_m`. Use `simulator.dynamics.orbit.drag` to enable aerodynamic
forces, `simulator.dynamics.reentry` for diagnostics and limits, and
`simulator.dynamics.rocket.aero` only for detailed rocket coefficient
refinements. Flat aliases such as `specs.drag_area_m2`, `specs.cd`, and
`specs.nose_radius_m` remain compatibility inputs.

## Estimation And Knowledge

The first four live-knowledge rows below describe the pre-v2 component library,
not a supported v2 satellite configuration surface. Their filter mathematics
remain available for composition work, but a v2 stack must expose them through
typed measurement adapters before claiming them as onboard capability. Batch OD
workflows remain separate ground/offline estimation products.

| ONP Dynamics Batch Orbit Determination | Pro | `sim.estimation.orbit_determination` / `solve_dynamics_orbit_determination` | Reference | Fits initial ECI Cartesian state and identifiable drag/Cd/SRP scales with ONP in the residual loop; supports full observation covariance, explicit priors, robust/rejection policy, observability diagnostics, grouped residual audits, fit/holdout evidence, and materialized scenarios. |
| ONP Native Ground-Sensor Orbit Determination | Pro | `sim.estimation.ground_station_od` / `sim.scale fit-ground-sensor-od` | Reference | Fits initial ECI Cartesian state against individual/combined azimuth, elevation, range, and range-rate rows; optional station/shared biases and clock terms carry priors and identifiability evidence, with elevation weighting, apparent-elevation refraction, station holdout/exclusion, and queryable review tables. |
| OGP Mean-Element Orbit Determination | Pro | `sim.estimation.ogp_od` plus legacy `sim.estimation.sgp4_od` / Scale commands | Experimental reference | Fits native TEME PV across named OGP-SGP4 and OGP-SDP4 regimes with automatic nonsingular/classical parameterization, fit/holdout evidence, and gated B*/epoch trials. Legacy fixed-epoch SGP4 PV and ground-sensor routes remain supported; Phase 6 is bounded same-family synthetic OD, not precise truth or operational TLE publication. |

## Orbital component library

These implementations are retained as component mathematics and historical
evidence. They are not top-level satellite scenario fields and their old
Reference/Workbench labels do not promote a complete v2 stack. Use the
component catalog when composing a custom stack, then test that composition
through the common boundary.

Actuator-aware orbital wrappers are covered in more detail in
[Actuators](actuators.md), but they are part of the controller inventory:

Additional orbital-control helpers, such as `PredictiveBurnScheduler`,
`OrbitalAttitudeManeuverCoordinator`, and the HCW transfer solvers, are library
building blocks rather than top-level user-selectable controllers.

## Attitude component library

These implementations are candidate component mathematics. They are not
configured through `attitude_control` in v2, and snap/surrogate state-changing
controllers are not physical GNC paths.

sun-track, spotlight, RIC-pointing, and target-facing commands. It is not a
standalone closed-loop controller.

## Legacy mission component inventory

The tables below inventory pre-v2 mission components for archaeology and rocket
ownership. Satellites do not execute these dictionary-producing modules. New
satellite mission behavior belongs inside a complete stack executive and typed
mission load; no Compatibility satellite module is a released runtime path.

Historically, mission logic was split into three related surfaces:

- **Mission strategies** decide intent: pursue, evade, hold, inspect,
  stationkeep, defend, or select a rocket orbital goal.
- **Mission execution modules** convert intent into integrated commands:
  pointing, predictive burns, gated burns, impulses, direct commands, or safe
  hold.
- **Mission modules** combined behavior into one plugin. These divisions remain
  relevant to rockets until their later overhaul, not to v2 satellites.

## Maintainer Notes

Runtime exports in `sim/control/orbit/__init__.py`,
`sim/control/attitude/__init__.py`, and `sim/mission/__init__.py` may include
additional workbench or compatibility items beyond the product-facing inventory.

When adding a new controller or mission behavior:

1. Follow [Controller Naming Conventions](project/controller_naming_conventions.md).
2. Check the [Reference GNC Library Roadmap](project/reference_gnc_library_roadmap.md)
   to decide whether the behavior is Reference, Workbench, Experimental,
   Compatibility, or Internal/Hook.
3. Add or update at least one runnable YAML example when the behavior is
   product-facing.
4. Update this inventory if users should know the feature ships with the
   product.
5. Add focused tests for any promoted user-facing behavior.
