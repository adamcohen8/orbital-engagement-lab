# Public Hosted OEL Client

**Hosted OEL is a closed alpha; access is not publicly available.** Public OEL
remains free to run locally without a Hosted account. The bundled client and
package validator do not grant service access, even when a local profile is
configured. Any private alpha access requires separate operator provisioning
and current service instructions; this client does not establish service
availability. The acceptance proof uses simulated settlement, not real
payments.

The public `oel hosted` command is a narrow client for a separately operated
Hosted OEL service. It does not contain OEL Pro executors, worker source,
service credentials, model credentials, payment logic, or a hidden simulation
engine. When an approved plan needs only public capabilities, local OEL is the
recommended zero-fee venue. The client contract describes controlled Hosted
offers, but its offer and approval commands do not establish service
availability.

This client is a local black-box reference implementation. Its transport
launches a user-configured argv command, sends one JSON request on standard
input, and reads one JSON response. It never invokes a shell. The local profile
link command is implemented; authenticated HTTPS, remote file transfer, and a
qualified deployed service boundary remain separate deployment work.

## Agent-visible flow

The intended flow is:

```text
discover capabilities -> create proposal -> classify or request hosted offer
-> user reviews exact quote -> explicit approval -> durable status
-> verified result import
```

When an authorized Hosted service is operating, it authors the authoritative
hosted preflight and quote. A frontier agent may prepare the request and
proposed plan, but it cannot authorize execution. The service persists each
authoritative offer for fifteen minutes and consumes it once. Approval requires
a short-lived user-scoped session whose signed subject matches
`--authorized-by`, plus the exact `APPROVE <offer_sha256>` confirmation after
the user reviews the offer.

Before staging, Public OEL can validate a complete public or Pro analysis
package without importing Pro code or uploading bytes:

```bash
oel hosted package-schema
oel hosted validate-package ./my-study --workspace-root .
```

The package reuses the public StudyRequest and StudyPlan contracts, binds actual
input hashes and byte counts, compiles typed operation edges, validates public
scenario inputs, and returns a `CLIENT_VALID` receipt whose route is
`LOCAL_FREE_AVAILABLE` or `HOSTED_PRO_REQUIRED`. See
`docs/hosted-pro-package.md`. The receipt is only a local planning and integrity
result. An authorized Hosted service would need to author the authoritative
validation receipt and quote from the exact sealed bytes.

## Link a scoped local profile

The profile stores a signed, scope-limited Hosted OEL session token and one
argv transport command. It does not store frontier-model provider credentials.
Treat the transport command as trusted local configuration. Linking a profile
does not establish that the Hosted service is available or authorize a study.

```bash
oel hosted profile link \
  --profile .oel/hosted/profile.json \
  --service-label hosted-oel-proof \
  --transport-command hosted-transport.json \
  --session-token hosted-session.json
```

`hosted-transport.json` contains an argv array, not a shell command:

```json
{
  "command": ["hosted-oel-transport"]
}
```

## Discover and route

```bash
oel hosted capabilities --profile .oel/hosted/profile.json
oel hosted route --planning-result planning-result.json
```

Routing has three explicit dispositions:

- `execution_options_available`: the plan uses public OEL capabilities, local
  execution is free and recommended. Routing does not report current Hosted
  service availability;
- `hosted_pro_offer`: the plan needs Pro. This identifies a Hosted route, not a
  currently available offer or entitlement; use a public fallback until an
  operator confirms a qualified service and authorizes access;
- `not_eligible`: clarify the request or prepare an optional capability
  feedback preview.

## Stage, offer, and approve

The commands below document the client protocol; they do not authorize an
upload, offer, or study. Do not send inputs or request an offer unless the
service owner confirms a qualified deployment and explicitly authorizes the
exact synthetic acceptance run and data scope.

Only exact user-selected files are staged. Their content digests must already
be bound by the validated package, request, and plan. Do not infer permission
for customer or proprietary data from a package receipt, profile, or offer.

```bash
oel hosted stage \
  --profile .oel/hosted/profile.json \
  --source completed-run.json \
  --input-id completed_run_input \
  --kind completed_run \
  --expected-sha256 SHA256

oel hosted offer \
  --profile .oel/hosted/profile.json \
  --request request.json \
  --plan proposed-plan.json \
  --grant GRANT_ID \
  --worker-image-sha256 IMAGE_SHA256

oel hosted approve \
  --profile .oel/hosted/profile.json \
  --offer hosted-offer.json \
  --idempotency-key USER_CHOSEN_KEY \
  --authorized-by USER_IDENTITY \
  --confirmation "APPROVE OFFER_SHA256"
```

Session tokens are issuer- and audience-bound, expire within eight hours, and
can be revoked by the service operator. Hosted profiles must remain mode 0600.
Upload grants are tenant-scoped, expiring, single-use records subject to both
per-object and cumulative tenant quotas.

The local proof records the pricing-policy digest, estimated usage, estimated
price, and maximum authorization. It meters and settles actual usage into a
`captured_local_proof` receipt but does not perform a real payment capture.

## Inspect, cancel, and import

```bash
oel hosted status JOB_ID --profile .oel/hosted/profile.json
oel hosted cancel JOB_ID --profile .oel/hosted/profile.json
oel hosted pull JOB_ID \
  --profile .oel/hosted/profile.json \
  --destination hosted-results/JOB_ID

oel hosted pull-review-slice JOB_ID \
  --profile .oel/hosted/profile.json \
  --destination selected-review/JOB_ID \
  --start-s 120 --end-s 180 \
  --object chaser --object target \
  --family state --family relative --family control --family events
```

The client verifies the result-transfer identity, every file size and digest,
and all relative paths before atomically creating the destination. It writes a
content-bound `result_import_receipt.json` beside the imported evidence.
`pull-review-slice` requires one completed single-run review store in the
hosted result. It creates the partial store on the service and transfers only
`review_slice.sqlite` and `slice_manifest.json` to the new local destination;
the complete result stays on the service. The imported slice is in the
`000-review_slice` child directory and can be queried with
`python -m sim.review slice query <slice-directory> --sql <SELECT-query>`.
The slice is explicitly partial review evidence, not a replacement for the
completed run or a continuation source; see [`docs/review-store.md`](review-store.md).
The local black-box transport still sends each selected file as one verified
base64 response; production HTTPS and chunked remote transfer remain separate
deployment work.

## Transaction ledger

Client actions append to `.oel/hosted/transactions.jsonl` by default. The
ledger is a chained, content-bound local record of routing, grants, offers,
approval, durable status, pricing-policy and spending-cap identities, and
imported artifact counts and bytes. It does not retain input contents, result contents, model
credentials, conversation history, or hosted internal paths.

The ledger is product telemetry evidence for a controlled pilot; it is not a
payment receipt, scientific qualification, or proof of customer satisfaction.
